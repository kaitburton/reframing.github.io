							<p>Today, my daughter got into what remains</p>

							<p>a chain link to all that he'd unraveled.</p>
							<p>One day, riding my bike downtown,</p>
							<p>I heard the "clink" as it fell to the ground.</p>
							<p>Whoever found it gained a new treasure,</p>
							<p>and I flew on out of there, lighter than ever.</p>

							<p>I lost a good amount of my kitchen supplies that day.</p>
							<p>I remember I used to cook for us all the time,</p>
							<p>but I haven't cooked much since.</p>

	        <p>Like an aversion to a certain food after a
	          stomach virus, trauma can linger in our lives,
	          clinging to material objects in the form of
	          haunting memories. Survivors of domestic abuse
	          know this in that their abusers maintaining
	          power over them by having ruined everyday
	          objects for them. One example might be one
	          of my participants who still can't stomach a
	          cheeseburger because of the lingering
	          memories of her ex insulting her body
	          constantly.</p>

	       <p>I've never experienced domestic abuse, but
	         I have experienced trauma, in that I lost my
	         older brother when I was barely 12 years old.
	         People often expect others to move on so quickly
	         after a trauma, perhaps because it isn't <i>literally</i>
	         happening anymore. Daniel Coburn, in his latest work,
	         "<a href: "http://lenscratch.com/2014/07/daniel-coburn-hereditary-estate/">The Hereditary Estate: Domestic Trauma and Vernacular
	         Photography</a>",
	          touches on the notion that we have a prescriptive
	          photo-taking style in which we always document
	          families in a happy manner, even when we arenâ€™t happy.
	          This translates to a greater need we foster:
	          we love to impose happiness on ourselves and others
	          when it couldn't be farther from the truth.
	         But trauma can live on, glued to
	         everyday items and experiences. This is certainly
	         true for survivors of domestic abuse and violence.
	         This year, I've begun to hear stories from people
	         who <i>have</i> lived through horrible domestic situations,
	         and I've found myself inspired by their stories.
	         They, too, are generally expected to be okay after
	         they've "gotten out" of the sphere of their abusers,
	         but the reality is that many times, the abusers still
	         linger in the damage they've caused.</p>

	      <p>The project was originally set to be titled
	        "Reclaimed Images." But according to dictionary.com,
	        "<a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/reclaim?s=t"> reclaim </a>"
	        means "to bring back to a preferable manner,"
	        implying a backward movement, or a return to a previous
	        state. Any survivor of trauma could tell you that there
	        is no going back, only forward. "<a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/frame?s=t"> Frame </a>,"
	        however, can be defined:
	        "to conceive or imagine" and
	        "to fashion or shape." It's moving forward. Dreaming
	        of a new future. It's what this project showcases: the
	        empowerment of these courageous people as they take
	        back their lives and imagine and shape new tomorrows. </p>

	      <p>Each participant, as she thought about and engaged with
	        the project, had to face certain realities of her daily
	        life that remained unspoken, perhaps even to herself.
	        Each survivor had to confront the negativities that clung
	        to whatever object she chose, and by doing just that,
	        she took another step forward in deciding a new reality
	        for that object in her life. I only asked if I could
	        help turn an introspective lens toward her own heart,
	        and in attempting to take a beautiful photograph, I
	        simply imagined through the lens what each woman already
	        knew: that every little thing in her life will be seen
	        in a new light as she continues forward, forging new
	        memories each and every day.</p>
