							<h2>Arin</h2>
							<p>There is a ring I lugged through every travel</p>
							<p>a chain link to all that he'd unraveled.</p>
							<p>One day, riding my bike downtown,</p>
							<p>I heard the "clink" as it fell to the ground.</p>
							<p>Whoever found it gained a new treasure,</p>
							<p>and I flew on out of there, lighter than ever.</p>

							<h2>Alaina</h2>
							<p>He demolished everything I'd been building:</p>
							<p>powders, brushes, aspirations coloring our floor.</p>
							<p>Today, my daughter got into what remains</p>
							<p>of my collection, and through her perception,</p>
							<p>reminded me of freedom of expression,</p>
							<p>and that it's still okay to cherish my dreams.</p>

							<h2>Aimee</h2>
							<p>Skating was our favorite hobby when he taught me,</p>
							<p>but when he changed and we split,</p>
							<p>I bured my board in the back of my closet.</p>
							<p>But sometimes now, I bring it to friends' hangouts,</p>
							<p>and their delight and play with my skateboard</p>
							<p>radiates joy that pushes me forward.</p>

							<h2>Ada</h2>
							<p>Coming to college I learned in Christian circles</p>
							<p>that "father" <i>doesn't</i> actually mean</p>
							<p>what <i>I</i> grew up thinking.</p>
							<p>My Heavenly Father's loving embrace</p>
							<p>is one I never before knew, and I praise Him because</p>
							<p>he's been changing my dad, too.</p>

							<h2>Franscesca</h2>
							<p>He wasn't physical until I came back for my belongings;</p>
							<p>I lost a good amount of my kitchen supplies that day.</p>
							<p>I remember I used to cook for us all the time,</p>
							<p>but I haven't cooked much since.</p>
							<p>It's freeing to think that now I could craft meals</p>
							<p>for another, or for friends, or even just for me.</p>

							<h2>Eleea</h2>
							<p>When my grandma gave my dolphin to me, she said,</p>
							<p>"It's fragile, but unbreakable, like you."</p>
							<p>He threatened every day to shatter it,</p>
							<p>and he managed to chip this fragile frame,</p>
							<p>but I found the God that Grandma always talked about</p>
							<p>and He's been putting me back together ever since.</p>
