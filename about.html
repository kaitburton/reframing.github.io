        <p>Like an aversion to a certain food after a
          stomach virus, trauma can linger in our lives,
          clinging to material objects in the form of
          haunting memories. Survivors of domestic abuse
          know this in that their abusers maintaining
          power over them by having ruined everyday
          objects for them. One example might be one
          of my participants who still can't stomach a
          cheeseburger because of the lingering
          memories of her ex insulting her body
          constantly.</p>

       <p>I've never experienced domestic abuse, but
         I have experienced trauma, in that I lost my
         older brother when I was barely 12 years old.
         People often expect others to move on so quickly
         after a trauma, perhaps because it isn't <i>literally</i>
         happening anymore. Daniel Coburn, in his latest work,
         "<a href: "http://lenscratch.com/2014/07/daniel-coburn-hereditary-estate/">The Hereditary Estate: Domestic Trauma and Vernacular
         Photography</a>",
          touches on the notion that we have a prescriptive
          photo-taking style in which we always document
          families in a happy manner, even when we arenâ€™t happy.
          This translates to a greater need we foster:
          we love to impose happiness on ourselves and others
          when it couldn't be farther from the truth.
         But trauma can live on, glued to
         everyday items and experiences. This is certainly
         true for survivors of domestic abuse and violence.
         This year, I've begun to hear stories from people
         who <i>have</i> lived through horrible domestic situations,
         and I've found myself inspired by their stories.
         They, too, are generally expected to be okay after
         they've "gotten out" of the sphere of their abusers,
         but the reality is that many times, the abusers still
         linger in the damage they've caused.</p>

      <p>The project was originally set to be titled
        "Reclaimed Images." But according to dictionary.com,
        "<a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/reclaim?s=t"> reclaim </a>"
        means "to bring back to a preferable manner,"
        implying a backward movement, or a return to a previous
        state. Any survivor of trauma could tell you that there
        is no going back, only forward. "<a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/frame?s=t"> Frame </a>,"
        however, can be defined:
        "to conceive or imagine" and
        "to fashion or shape." It's moving forward. Dreaming
        of a new future. It's what this project showcases: the
        empowerment of these courageous people as they take
        back their lives and imagine and shape new tomorrows. </p>

      <p>Each participant, as she thought about and engaged with
        the project, had to face certain realities of her daily
        life that remained unspoken, perhaps even to herself.
        Each survivor had to confront the negativities that clung
        to whatever object she chose, and by doing just that,
        she took another step forward in deciding a new reality
        for that object in her life. I only asked if I could
        help turn an introspective lens toward her own heart,
        and in attempting to take a beautiful photograph, I
        simply imagined through the lens what each woman already
        knew: that every little thing in her life will be seen
        in a new light as she continues forward, forging new
        memories each and every day.</p>
